            <h1>History of Cryptography</h1>
        </header>
        <p>The art of cryptography is said to be as old as writing with the origins found in Roman and Egyptian civilizations.  The earliest example of an alphabetic 
            substitution cipher is the Caeser shift cipher which encrypts the message by moving the letters by a selected number, commonly 3 places. One modern example of cryptography that is still used today
            is the practice of Steganography.  In this encryption method the information is protection by concealment and it prevents an unauthorized person from seeing that data such as the method of invisible 
            watermarking.<br>
